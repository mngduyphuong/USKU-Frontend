        Our deliveries and services are performed exclusively under the General
        Terms and Conditions of Sale set forth hereinafter. They apply also to
        all future transactions conducted between the contracting parties
        without requiring further special reference to them. They shall apply
        also to contracts concluded at a later date even if we do not expressly
        refer to them specifically, and even if we perform our deliveries or
        services to the Orderer without reservation in full knowledge of
        standard terms and conditions of the Orderer that are contrary to or
        deviate from our General Terms and Conditions. The Orderer has full
        knowledge of our General Terms and Conditions, gained through our price
        lists, emails, and Internet publications.

        </h4>
        To the ordering part are non-binding. The order alone shall constitute a
        binding offer. Acceptance of this offer takes place at our discretion
        either by sending a confirmation of order or by performing the ordered
        deliveries or services without reservation. The technical data and
        descriptions contained in our product information or advertising
        materials and technical data sheets, and the information and data
        provided by the manufacturer or his auxiliary persons shall not
        constitute warranties as to the properties, quality, or durability of
        goods within the meaning of item 3 of Article 459 of the Obligation Code
        (Obligacijski zakonik, hereafter: “OZ”) to be delivered by us, unless
        such information is agreed under an individual contract. Identified
        uses, as defined under the European chemicals directive REACH, that are
        relevant to the goods shall constitute neither an agreed contractual
        property of the goods nor a form of use provided by the contract. If
        goods are sold on the basis of a sample or a specimen, such sample or
        specimen this shall merely be considered a description of proper
        technical compliance with the sample or specimen but not a guarantee or
        warranty of the properties or durability of the goods to be delivered by
        us. We provide technical support to the best of our knowledge. All and
        any data and information provided as to the suitability and utilisation
        of our goods does not release the buyer from examining and testing the
        goods for their suitability for their intended purposes.

          III. Prices, terms of payment, default in payment
        </h4>

        The prices agreed upon the conclusion of contract, and in particular the
        prices stated in the order from and/or the confirmation of the order,
        shall apply. If no price has been expressly determined, the prices in
        effect at the time of the conclusion of contract as per our price list
        shall apply. The prices are calculated on the basis of the volume,
        weights, and quantities determined by us, unless the Orderer objects
        immediately upon receipt of the goods. These prices (net order value)
        are plus the current statutory value added tax as at the date of
        delivery and – where agreed – the cost of the transport insurance. In
        the case of deliveries outside Australia, other country-specific dues and
        charges may be added. The resulting amount is the final total invoice
        amount (incl. VAT). We reserve the right to reasonably adjust our prices
        in the event of changes of costs occurring after the conclusion of
        contract due to collective wage agreement, increases in pre-suppliers’
        prices, or exchange rate fluctuations. Notification of such price
        changes is given no later than four weeks prior to the effectiveness of
        the new prices. Unless the ordering party objects in writing to the new
        prices within one week of notification, the new prices are considered
        accepted. This shall not apply if a fixed price is agreed. Our invoices
        are payable without deduction within 30 days of the invoice date, unless
        a different date for payment has been agreed. Upon expiration of the due
        date specified in the invoice, the Orderer is in default pursuant to
        Article 299.1 of the OZ . In the event that we grant our customers a
        discount, the discount amount is calculated on the basis of the final
        total invoice amount (incl. VAT), less a flat-rate freight charge of 8%,
        the cost of a transport insurance where applicable, and – in the case of
        deliveries outside Australia – any other country-specific charges. The
        Orderer is entitled to a right to set-off our claims only if his counter
        claims are res judicata, undisputed, or have been acknowledged by us.
        Furthermore, the Orderer shall be entitled to exercise a retention right
        only if his counter claim is based on the same contractual relationship.
        If the Orderer fails to pay due invoices, observe a payment term, or in
        the event that the Orderer’s financial situation deteriorates after the
        conclusion of the contract, or if, after the conclusion of contract, we
        obtain unfavourable information relating to the Orderer that give rise
        to doubts as to the orderings party’s solvency or credit-worthiness, we
        are entitled to accelerate the maturity and declare immediately due the
        Orderer’s residual debt, and, contrary to the agreement, demand advance
        payment, or payment of a security, or, upon delivery, immediate payment
        of all our receivables that are based on the same legal relationship.
        This shall apply in particular if the Orderer ceases his payments, a
        check issued by the Orderer is not honoured, insolvency proceedings
        against the Orderer’s assets are applied for or instituted, or if an
        application for such insolvency proceedings are rejected due to a lack
        of assets.

          IV. Dates for delivery and payment, delay in performance
        </h4>

        Delivery dates are estimates, unless a fixed date for the transactions
        has been expressly agreed in writing. Delivery periods are given under
        the reservation that the Orderer meets his contractual duties of
        cooperation. In the event, that, nevertheless, agreed delivery dates are
        not observed for reasons for which we are responsible, the Orderer may
        withdraw from the contract after a period of grace of no less than 15
        business days set by the Orderer has expired fruitlessly. Withdrawal
        must be by written notice. Deliveries on Saturdays are possible only
        upon special agreement and for an extra charge. We will be in default
        only upon the expiration of a reasonable grace period of no less than 15
        business days set by the Orderer. In cases of force majeure and other
        unforeseeable, extraordinary circumstances for which we are not
        responsible, for example operational troubles and interruptions due to
        fire, water, or similar events, failures of production facilities and
        machines, late delivery, or delivery shortfalls on the part of our
        suppliers, and interruptions in operation due to a shortage in raw
        materials, energy or labour, strike, lockout, difficulties in the
        procurement of transportation means, disruptions or obstructions in
        traffic, or official intervention, we are – to the extent that the named
        circumstances prevent us from a timely performance of our obligations -
        entitled to postpone the performance of the delivery and/or service for
        the term of the obstruction plus a reasonable start-up time. If,
        consequently, the performance of the delivery or service is delayed for
        more than one month, both we and the Orderer are entitled to withdraw
        from the contract by written notice in respect of the quantities
        affected by the delay in delivery, excluding any damages claims and in
        accordance with No. VIII 1 – 5 of the present General Terms and
        Conditions of Sale. In each individual case of default, our obligation
        to pay damages is limited under the provisions of Ziff. VIII 1-5. We are
        entitled to perform partial delivery and partial services within the
        agreed delivery and performance periods if reasonable to the Orderer.
        Observance of our delivery and performance obligations is subject to the
        due and proper performance of the Orderer’s obligations. We reserve the
        right to plea non-fulfilment of the contract. Costs claimed for
        downtimes or manipulation will be reimbursed only if legitimate and only
        to the amount of the freight costs of the deliveries concerned. In the
        case that the Orderer is in default with calling, accepting, or
        collecting the goods or services, or if the Orderer is responsible for a
        delay of the shipment or the service of the goods, we are entitled
        without prejudice to any other claims, to demand payment of a flat-rate
        in the amount of the usual local storage charges, regardless of whether
        the goods are stored in our facilities or those of a third party. The
        Orderer bears the burden of proof of lower or no damage..

        <h4 class="header">
          V. Passing of the risk, shipment and packaging costs
        </h4>

        Shipment is at the risk of the Orderer on principle, i.e. even if
        pricing free destination station or free building site is agreed. We are
        under no obligation whatsoever to insure the goods. If the buyer is in
        default with acceptance or in arrears, the risk of accidental loss or
        deterioration of the goods passes to him. The same applies in the case
        of a violation of other obligations to cooperate. In the event that we
        perform any loading and/or discharging under individual contractual
        provisions, such services shall be performed under the General Freight
        Handling and Transportation Regulations (ADSp) of the forwarder or
        carrier that apply to the respective shipment or transport. Claims for
        damages may be raised against us only in cases of gross culpability
        (wilful intent, gross negligence). Prices are inclusive of standard
        packaging, free destination, unloading excluded, in complete loading
        materials, unless a different form of carriage has been expressly
        agreed. If a form of packaging other than the standard form of packaging
        is used upon the Orderer’s request, it shall be billed at cost price. If
        the goods are shipped on Euro pallets, the latter will be billed to the
        Orderer; carriage free return shipments of the Euro pallets in undamaged
        condition to one of our plants/distribution centres, will be refunded by
        credits less an administrative charge to be individually agreed. Any
        self-discharging by truck or crane is at the Orderer’s risk.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <h4 class="header">VI. Orderer’s obligations /Reservation of title</h4>
        Ownership of the delivered goods shall remain with us until full payment
        of the purchase price and any other current or future receivables
        resulting from our business relationship with the Orderer. The
        incorporation of the purchase price in an ongoing invoice and the
        acceptance of the balance will not affect the reservation of title. The
        Orderer is obliged to treat the purchased goods carefully until full
        ownership has been acquired. The Orderer may neither pledge nor give as
        a security the goods owned by us. However, he shall be entitled to
        resell the delivered goods within the scope of a proper and correct
        business transaction in accordance with the following terms. The
        aforementioned right shall not apply in as much as the Orderer transfers
        or pledges claims in advance against his contractual partner – where
        effective -, that result from the resale of the goods, to a third party
        or has agreed with that third party an effective prohibition of
        assignment in advance. The Orderer herewith immediately assigns to us
        all – future and contingent – accounts receivable resulting from a
        resale of the goods delivered by us, together with all ancillary rights,
        at an amount of 100% gross of the value of the delivered goods, which
        will take precedence over the residual part of his accounts receivable.
        We herewith accept the assignment. As long as and inasmuch as the
        Orderer settles his payment obligations to us, he is entitled to collect
        the claims assigned to us from his customers, within the scope of proper
        and orderly business. However, he is not entitled to conclude an
        accounts current agreement, or agree a prohibition of assignment, with
        his customers in relation to these accounts receivable, or transfer or
        pledge them to third parties. If, contrary to Sentence 2, an account
        current relationship exists between the Orderer and the purchasers of
        our reserved goods, the account receivable assigned in advance shall
        also relate to the accepted balance and, in the case of the purchaser’s
        insolvency, to the balance existing at that date. Upon our request, the
        Orderer shall provide evidence separately of the individual accounts
        receivable assigned to us, and notify his debtors of the assignment
        together with the request to pay to us the value of our claims against
        the Orderer. We are entitled to notify the Orderer’s debtors ourselves
        of the assignment and collect the receivables. However, we will not make
        use of this power as long as the Orderer duly meets his payment
        obligations without delay, no application for insolvency proceedings
        against the Orderer is filed, and the Orderer does not cease his
        payments. If, however, one of the aforementioned cases occurs, we may
        demand that the Orderer disclose to us the receivables assigned and
        their debtors, furnishes all information required for collection of the
        receivables, and surrenders to us all related documents. In the case of
        seizures or other third party intervention, the Orderer shall notify us
        in writing without undue delay. If the goods delivered by us under
        reservation of title are processed, combined, or mixed, together with
        other objects that are not our property, we acquire co-ownership of the
        new object in the proportion of the value of the goods delivered by us
        (total invoice amount, incl. VAT) to the value of the other objects at
        the time of processing, combining, or mixing. The object created by such
        processing shall be subject to the same terms as the goods delivered
        under reservation of title. In the event that such processing,
        combining, or mixing, occurs in such a manner that the Orderer’s object
        must be considered the principal object, it is deemed agreed that the
        Orderer transfers co-ownership to us pro rata. The Orderer is entitled,
        within the scope of proper and orderly business operations, to dispose
        of the products created by such processing, alteration, combination, or
        mixing, excluding pledging or assignment, provided he meets his
        obligations resulting from the business relationship with us, in a
        timely manner. The Orderer herewith immediately assigns to us, as
        security and in the amount of our portion of the ownership, his accounts
        receivable resulting from the sale of these new products to which we are
        entitled as co-owners. For the event that the Orderer combines or mixes
        the delivered goods with a different principal object he herewith
        immediately assigns to us his claims against the third party up to the
        value of our goods. We herewith accept the assignment. Furthermore, the
        Orderer assigns to us his receivables up to the value of our goods as a
        security for our receivables resulting from the processing, combining of
        our goods with real property against a third party. We agree to release,
        upon the Orderer’s request, the securities of our choice to which we are
        entitled, to the extent that the realisable value of our securities
        exceeds our receivables from the Orderer, that are the matter to be
        secured, by more than 20%. In the case that the Orderer breaches the
        contract, in particular in the case of a delay in payment amounting to
        more than 10% of the invoice value for a significant period of time, we
        are – without prejudice to other (damages) claims – entitled to withdraw
        from the contract and demand that the goods delivered by us be returned
        to us. Upon acceptance of the returned goods we are entitled to exploit
        them. The proceeds from such exploitation will be credited to our
        accounts receivable from the Orderer, less reasonable exploitation
        costs.

          VII. Orderer’s rights in the case of non-conformity
        </h4>

        Obvious defects, delivery of the wrong goods, and deviations in
        quantity, shall be reported to us in writing by the Orderer without
        undue delay, no later however than 3 days from the Orderer’s receipt of
        the goods. Concealed defects shall be reported to us within a period of
        eight days following their discovery. The buyer is obliged, if necessary
        by way of trial processing, to check whether the delivered goods are
        free of defects and suitable for the intended utilisation. This shall
        also apply if the goods are to be processed in systems that are not
        procured from us. In the event that defects emerge at the time of
        processing, operations shall be immediately suspended and any original
        containers not yet processed and unopened shall be secured. She shall be
        furnished o us upon request for examination. Three months following the
        passing of the risk to the Orderer under No. V. 1, complaints of
        non-conformity are excluded and are considered untimely if they could
        have been reasonably discovered. In the case of a complaint of
        non-conformity that is made improperly or in an untimely manner (No. VII
        Sentence 1 and 2), the Orderer loses his rights resulting from
        non-conformity subject to the terms of No. VIII 1 to 5 of these present
        Terms and Conditions of Sale, unless we fraudulently concealed the
        defect. In the case that the goods delivered by us are defective, we are
        obliged only, at out choice, to subsequently repair the defect
        (subsequent improvement) or to deliver fault-free goods (subsequent
        performance). If we are unwilling or unable to carry out subsequent
        performance, or if subsequent performance is postponed for an
        unreasonable period of time through our fault, or if it fails for other
        reasons, the Orderer shall be entitled at his choice to withdraw from
        the contract, or to demand reduction of the purchase price. Subsequent
        improvement is considered failed following the second attempt, unless
        something else results from the nature of the matter or other
        circumstances. If, due to the goods delivered by us, the Orderer has
        suffered a loss, or incurred futile expenditure, our liability shall be
        subject to No. VII.1 and II, No. VIII. 1 to 5 and No. IX.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <h4 class="header">VIII. Rights and obligations of our company</h4>

        A liability on the part of our company for damages or futile expenditure
        – regardless of the legal basis – shall arise only if the damage or the
        futile expenditure a) has been caused by us by culpably breaching a
        material contractual obligation or<br />

        b) is due to a grossly negligent or wilful breach of obligations through
        us<br />

        According to No. VIII. 1 a) and b) we are liable for damage or futile
        expenditure that is not caused by advice or information furnished
        against separate remuneration, only in the case of a wilful or grossly
        negligent breach of obligations, provided this breach of obligation does
        not constitute a defect (Article 459 of OZ) of the goods delivered by
        us.
        <br /><br />
        In the event that we are liable under No. VIII. 1. a) for a breach of a
        material contractual obligation through no wilful intent or gross
        negligence, our liability is limited to the typical foreseeable damage.
        In this case, we are not liable in particular for lost profits of the
        Orderer or for unforeseeable indirect consequential damage. The
        aforementioned limitation of liability under Sentence 1 and 2 shall
        apply likewise to damage caused through the wilful intent or gross
        negligence on the part of our employees, personnel, or authorised
        persons. We are not liable for indirect losses or damage of the Orderer
        suffered by him due to a claim for a contractual penalty raised against
        him by a third party. The limitations in liability set forth hereinabove
        under No VIII. 1. to 2. do not apply if our liability is mandatory under
        the product liability regulations , or if claims are raised on the
        grounds of an injury to life, the body, or health. In the case that the
        goods delivered by us lack a warranted property, we shall be liable only
        for such damage the prevention/absence of which was covered by the
        warranty. Any further liability for damages exceeding that provided for
        under Nos. VIII. 1 – 3, - irrespective of the legal nature of the claim
        raised – is excluded. This applies particularly for the damages claims
        based on culpa in contrahendo, for the claims for damages caused in
        relation to performance of contractual obligations, or tortuous acts
        (Article 133 of the OZ). We are not liable in the case of impossibility
        or a delay in the due and proper compliance with public law obligations
        caused by the Orderer in relation to the European chemicals directive
        REACH. Where this liability for damages is excluded or restricted under
        No. VIII 1 – 4, this shall also apply to the personal liability for
        damages on the part of our employees, personnel, representatives and
        auxiliary persons and vicarious agents.

        <h4 class="header">IX. Limitation of claims</h4>

        Claims of the Orderer pertaining to defects of the goods delivered by us
        or to services performed in breach of our obligations – including
        damages claims and claims for reimbursement of futile expenses – are
        limited to a period of one year, unless otherwise provided for under
        Nos. IX. 2. to 4 hereinafter, or the law prescribes longer limitation
        periods. In the case that we provided incorrect consulting that is not
        invoiced separately and/or furnished information in breach of our
        obligations, without delivering any goods in connection with the
        consultation or the information, or without the consultation or the
        information constituting a defect of goods delivered by us (Article 459
        of OZ), any claims based thereupon shall expire within one year from the
        date of statutory commencement of limitation. If the aforesaid breach of
        obligations constitutes a defect (Article 459 of OZ) in the goods
        delivered by us in connection with the consultation or the information,
        the resulting claims shall be subject to the terms of limitation
        provided for under Nos. 1 and 2 and 4. The provisions set forth under
        Nos. 1 to 3, shall not apply to the limitation of claims based on
        injuries to life, the body or health, or to the limitation of claims
        under the Australian product liability regulations and on the grounds of
        defects in title of the goods delivered by us that pertain to a third
        party’s right in rem, on the grounds of which he may demand that the
        goods delivered by us be surrendered. Furthermore, they do not apply to
        the limitation of claims of our Orderer/customer that are based on a
        fraudulent concealment on our part of defects of the goods delivered by
        us, or on a breach of our obligations through our wilful intent or gross
        negligence. In the cases specified under this present No. IX: 3, the
        statutory limitation periods shall apply to the mentioned claims.

        Returns of goods delivered by us that are free of defects are excluded.
        If, in exceptional cases, we agree with the return of a fault-free item,
        it shall be credited to the Orderer only if we are able to determine
        that the goods are fully reusable. At least 20% of the invoice value, or
        at least 30 euros, will deducted for the cost of examination, treatment,
        alteration, and repackaging. Such a credit balance will not be paid out
        but credited against future deliveries.

        The place of performance and exclusive place of jurisdiction for all
        claims arising between us and merchants, or legal entities, or special
        funds, under public law, is our registered seat. Unless mandatory
        statutory provisions provide otherwise, we are also entitled, however,
        to file actions against an Orderer at his statutory place of
        jurisdiction. The legal relationship between our company and the Orderer
        is governed exclusively by the laws of the Australia. The application of
        the provisions of the UN Convention on the Contracts for the
        International Sale of Goods (CISG – UN Purchase Law) is excluded. Where
        commercial terms have been mutually agreed under the International
        Commercial Terms (INCOTERMS), the latest version of the INCOTERMS, as
        amended, shall apply (currently INCO­TERMS 2020).
